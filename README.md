# Hi there 👋

I'm a Product Manager who bridges the gap between business strategy and technical execution, with 5+ years building SaaS and marketplace products across Europe. I love using data and AI to solve real problems, and I'm currently experimenting with AI-augmented product development through personal projects while leading platform initiatives in automotive tech.

## What I'm Building
Tacker - A personal finance tracker built to keep finances undercontrol with simplicity.

In 2020, I created an Excel spreadsheet to track my expenses. It worked beautifully for me - just 5 minutes per week to maintain complete financial clarity. Friends asked to use it, but sharing meant exporting copies and explaining complex formulas. That friction sparked an idea: what if I could deliver the same value through an intuitive app that anyone could use?

Tacker was born from this philosophy: financial tracking should take 5 minutes per week, not hours.

This project represents my journey from concept to shipped product - a dual-platform financial tracking application (web + iOS) that combines thoughtful product design with modern technical architecture.
